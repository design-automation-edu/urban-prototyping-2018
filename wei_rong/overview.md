The project attempts the New York City gridded master plan superimposed on the site as well taking into consideration the surrounding site context.Three main iterations were carried out with the gridded master plan in mind. The first iteration explores the arrnagement of  workflow to produce a flexibible system that infers from the context to divide the proposed site. The second iteration as an extention of the first iteration explores the distribution of density based on the surrounding context. The third iteration explores a more indepth subdivision of the plots based on the surrounding context. In the third iteration a mixture of courtyard and staggered building layout  gave the best overall results.
