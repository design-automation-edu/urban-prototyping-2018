# The grids

**LIM Wei Rong**

The project attempts the New York City gridded master plan, one of the most recognised street network. The gridded plan has been lauded for wayfinding and walkability. In this project the gridded street pattern is superimposed on the site, whilst still taking into consideration the surrounding site context. Three main iterations were carried out with the gridded master plan in mind and imporvement were made within each iterations. The first iteration explores the arrangement of workflow to produce a flexibible system that infers from the context to divide the proposed site. The second iteration as an extention of the first iteration explores the distribution of density based on the surrounding context. The third iteration explores a more indepth subdivision of the plots based on the surrounding context. The third iteration, which employed a mixture of courtyard and staggered building layout gave the best overall results.
