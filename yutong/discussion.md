## Inspiration 

Although there are still room for improvement, a few red buildings left, but the desired effect has been achieved. As you can see, Iteration3 gets the best results,
When new meets old has put forward an optimization idea that is universally applicable to urban construction. It is not only applicable to Singapore, but can be extended to other cities in similar situations. Further, its land use nature is not limited to residential areas, even it can also simulate how to minimize the impact of high buildings when a point-layout CBD is planned next to a residential area.

## Learning methods

This study starts from first meeting with Houdini, and understanding that Houdini is a large software not only for film and television animation, but also can be used in urban planning and architectural design. In short two weeks, the course let me know about a kind of logical way of thinking. Although sometimes, the tedious nodes always make me confused. But the sense of accomplishment that I get through each time keeps me going. When a iteration was done, a lot of interesting things can be found by reviewing the process. Compared with 3D Max, what makes me feel more profound is the difference between them. 3D Max focuses on polygon modeling, while Houdini is a node-like modeling software which based on architecture. In my opinion, it is far from enough to learn software like Houdini only by the knowledge gained from class, since it is totally different from traditional modeling software. When learning, it is not suggested to follow a fixed pattern, thinking is inevitable, and more importantly, we should be patient, because the process of iterating is always troublesome and tedious.
