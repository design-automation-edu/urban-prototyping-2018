Three iterations are generated in order to explore the overall evaluation of urban areas constructed by two kind of urban fabrics under the influence of traffic leading factors, so as to obtain the optimal daylight, view and solar while improving the residential density as much as possible. The applicable situation is that when modern high-rise residential areas and traditional flat commercial residential areas meet in urban planning, attention would be paid to how to optimize the road network, building form, program mix, so as to achieve the optimal economic and technical indicators in residential areas and maximize the interests of developers.
The overall train of thought can be divided into road network construction, program mix, buildings generation, and final simulation. If look from the top down, in order to build an urban cluster, we first need to disassemble the entire urban blueprint into corresponding blocks, and then map the corresponding blocks to different urban clusters.
