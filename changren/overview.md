# Simulation of apartment blocks

**WANG ChangRen**

Abstract: The proposal is initiated from the Ville Radieuse,and a series of residential design influenced by it. Some of them have proven to be failed works, and some are still widely recognized in some countries. These simulations aim to explore whether this mode of residence can achieve extremely high sunshine and greening based on the sacrifice of humanized design. At the same time, we also explored some more extreme developments.

The final result shows that on the basis of the guaranteed orientation, the high-density housing does give a large amount of public space on the ground, and at the same time guarantees high sunshine to residences. If only the physical parameters are concerned and the north-south orientation is less than 20 meters.,then the higher the density of the dwelling is, the better the outcome is.
