To improve the urban performance of the site, whilst enhancing the narrative of the pocket urban spaces that weave in and out of each other, the urban typologies were further refined to create four main urban types:

1. Mid-low Rise Commercial Strip with Residential Spaces on top

2. Porous Residential Blocks: Made with a single script of overlapping L shaped blocks
The blocks responded parametrically to the different sizes of the plot to create varying urban blocks, from low rise courtyard typologies to high rise tower typology.

3. Single Twist Office tower block

4. Industrial Block consisting of two types:
a. Courtyard Block with L shaped footprint on top 
b. Typical Block
