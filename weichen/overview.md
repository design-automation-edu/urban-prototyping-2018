Crossing Connections

**SUN Weichen **

Abstract: My project proposed to make a self-sustaining ecosystem, generating a mixture of blocks for the residential, industrial, office and commercial function. Influenced by the surrounding facilities and aimed to make surrounded blocks for residential to help people get close to each other. It can be divided into three main iterations, the first one brought out the main idea while the other two of them attemped to improve evaluation results.

Iteration 1: Setting up basic urban elements, showing accessibility to MRT stations and creating a buffer zone for the AYE.

Iteration 2: Enrich functions, make it more reasonable, and generate buildings and blocks by the response of evaluation. 

Iteration 3: Recreate the form of block, rearrange “bad building”, pay attention to public spaces such as green spaces and sharing areas for public interaction, get better evaluation result.
