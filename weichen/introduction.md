# Introduction

The proposed site is situated between National University of Singapore and one-north. Surrounded by three MRT stations which is one north, dover and kent ridge and an AYE line.  Our assignment is to rearrange it for 75,000 residents, each person need 22 sqm of residential areas and 15 sqm of other areas. I supposed to create a self-sustaining ecosystem, with a mixture of blocks for the residential, industrial, office and commercial functions. With the help of Houdini, we can evaluate urban areasâ€™ daylight, view and solar factors as well as other leading factors, in order to achieving a sustainable building typology.The overall train of thought can be divided into road network construction, program mix, buildings generation, and final simulation.

Design Goals

- Making it walkability
- Making every blocks accessible and having clear network
- Each urban block contents integrating public space and green space
- Study and doing research to find suitable urban prototyping 
- Promote urban facilitate connectivity

Evaluation of Building Performance

-	Good window thresholds
- View factor > 0.4
-	Daylight factor > 0.1
-	Solar factor < 0.2
-	Good building thresholds
-	Passive area ratio > 0.5
-	Good window threshold > 0.1
