“Crossroads” present a design strategy to integrate the industrial and residential functions through utilizing the synergy produced from the flows of pedestrian and traffic. Perpendicular axes coupled with extensive boulevards promise a pleasant ground level experience. The size of blocks are designed to match those of the surrounding so as to preserve a similar sense of scale in the neighborhood. 

Connectivity is placed as a top most priority, hence porosity of the ground level and comfort level of streets are given much consideration in the assessment of the performance of the design. 

While the final iteration produced satisfactory results in terms of the considerations mentioned, there is still room for improvement in terms of the homogeneity within each typology and their respective efficiency in terms of occupancy load. Nonetheless, this proposal will stand as a promising start to the planning of this plot of land.
