# Iteration 1

The first attempt involves a classification of the plots into 3 different types, residential, commercial and industrial. Each type was then designed with a separate set of attributes and conditions to present different environment in response to their method of use. 

Each residential plot was subdivided to form a mixture of longitudinal blocks of average 25m width (double loaded towers) and point blocks of average 35m in width. Blocks are designed with sufficient space in between to prevent excessive shading while promising a well shaded ground level environment. 

Industrial blocks are designed with a recessed setback of 12m to create a green boulevard between the industrial blocks and the commercial zone. As a result, the built volume will also increase in height due to a smaller footprint. The volumes will thus form a barrier to shield against the AYE road. 

Commercial blocks in the core of the site are kept low while 10% of the total floor area for site is dedicated for its use.
